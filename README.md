# Zksync WFT

Idea is to collect all the addresses, hashes etc from zksync ecosystem - and offer an easy way to search for stuff.

Things to have:

[X] - plonk / fflonk verification keys

[X] - airbender verification keys

[] - zksync os app.bin verifications

[] - combined (FRI) airbender verications

[] - combined (Final) airbender verifications

[] - comined (SNARK) airbender + boojum verification

[x] - contract addresses 

[X] - chain ids

[X] - urls to things 

[] - search box to treat each word separately (fuzzy)
